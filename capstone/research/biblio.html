        <p>This peer-reviewed article researches the role of the metaverse and how it can affect the future of mental health. The author discloses how the metaverse can be both useful or detrimental to users depending on how spread out its application will be. They suggest that the metaverse may be helpful in improving mental health through tools such as virtual reality–assisted therapy, avatar therapy, and teletherapy. However, it might also grow similar to social media and create an unhealthy mental environment for vulnerable users. Thus, the author insists on conducting further research into the metaverse to forsee any problems. I think this article would help my project because it questions the use of future technology in mental health, which is something I'd like to explore. </p>

        <p>This research article briefly touches on the use of VR and cybertherapy for the future. They mostly mention the spread of technology and how it has become more common to be using teletherapy. Soon, it would be no problem to incorporate augmented reality into therapy as well, especially if there is not enough workers to take on counseling jobs. This article is a good topic for me to look deeper into since I plan on exploring the future of technology and mental health. However, the article is not really insightful and is too brief to reference. Furthermore, I would not use this as a credible source.</p>

            Minerva, Francesca, and Alberto Giubilini. “Is AI the Future of Mental Healthcare?” Topoi 42.3 (2023): 809–817. Web.

        <p>This book evaluates the use of AI and how it can be incorporated into the future of mental health services. The author discusses how  AI may be initially strong in helping diagnose patients but weak in providing empathy. The presence of AI may help make receiving mental health resources more accessible, especially for those who do not prefer human interaction and have low income. It will also reduce the overall social stigma of getting therapy. This topic will strengthen my capstone project because I am focused on envisioning a potential future for mental health, and how it may be affected by technological advancement. The book is peer-reviewed and the author lists many credible references for me to use.</p>
