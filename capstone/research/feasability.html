    <h1>Capstone Project - Coding Components & Feasability Report</h1>

    <h2>A list of features I plan to include:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>A button in the shape of a phone for user interaction with a click and hold effect</li>
        <li>Timeline with highlighted points</li>
        <li>Animations of the character off-phone and on-phone</li>     
        <li>A health bar status</li>     
        <li>Overlays of characterâ€™s storyline</li>      
    </ul>

    <h2>The technologies required to build each feature:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>HTML</li>     
        <li>Jquery plugins?</li>     
        <li>Illustrator or procreate OR p5 to make illustrations
        </li>      
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Assessment:</h2>
    <p>Although there are a lot of techniques I need to learn in order to include all of the features I have planned, I think it will be possible for me to learn within the timeframe that we have. I can also use jquery plugins that might provide design shortcuts. I will also be able to refer to techniques learned in our previous courses as well. </p>
