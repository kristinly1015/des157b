    <h1>Capstone Project - Usability Testing Results</h1>

    <h2>Three Observations</h2>
    <p>One observation I saw was that the user had confusion with using the sliders. It was probably too narrow for mouse accessibility. The two different sliders were also confusing for the user since they didn't know what to do with them at first.</p>

    <p>Another thing I noticed is that it took a long time for the user to read the introduction screen. The text may be too heavy and it took them about a minute or two to read all of it. They also were confused with the text not updating in the detail panel.</p>

    <p>A third observation is that the health bar status seemed confusing since it wasn't indicating what was wrong with the character. This is because I hadn't updated the detail panel to update based on the slider use. The user didn't know what was really happening during testing.</p>

    <h2>What I Need to Update</h2>
    <p>In order to improve my project, I plan to reduce the cognitive load of the sliders by either simplifying the age status to be only 4 variables, or removing the age labels to reduce the size of the slider to be adjustable to ages 0-100. I will also make both sliders the same orientation and have them next to each other instead of separate. I will also update my character visuals and include it inside the detail panel for cleaner aesthetics. I will also work on layout adjustments to the health bar, footer, and information to be more organized. Overall, I will continue building on the CSS and Javascript.</p>
