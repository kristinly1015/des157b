    <h1>Capstone Project - Proposal</h1>

    <p>My topic for the capstone project is the stigmas around mental health and how it is hard to speak up due to the fear of judgement from others, or from the lack of resources available. The target audience would be those struggling with mental health and do not have access to help or a safe space for emotional support. I plan on working on this project solo and may rely on challenging mental models the most. This is because the norm in society is to privately discuss your mental challenges, which discourages educational awareness on mental health, when it is just as important as physical health. People are afraid of being viewed as “crazy” or “unstable” when dealing with mental health issues should be more normalized. Aside from challenging mental models, I may also incorporate the lens of data visualization.

    <p>In terms of my project structure, I may go toward a story-telling route with a narrative of a specific character so that it can connect to the users on a deeper, humanistic level. I imagine there would be a faceless figure the user can select as they go through a series of slides for data statistics and learn how it ties into the story of the character. It may also be just a static room of the character with different interactive elements to look through such as a journal, a picture album, phone, etc. It may also be a platform where the character provides an example story that encourages users to submit in their anonymous mental health battles to share to other users so that they understand they’re not alone.</p>

    <p>I am still considering options at the moment, but I feel it will be challenging to choose a specific direction. I also fear the difficulty of coding these different ideas with my time and capabilities. I would hate to develop an established vision of what I want to portray but then not be able to execute it into code seamlessly. Overall, I think I have a good start and throughout the project, I can always ask for assistance in class.</p>
