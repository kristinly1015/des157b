            <h2>Project Overview</h2>

            <div class="content">

                <p>This capstone project takes on a dystopian narrative of the future with the growing global lifestyle of everyday phone use. I chose to focus on this topic because there is a strong dependency on technology in society, and people aren't researching the potential hazards of this social norm. The project aims to spread awareness on the dangerous effects of excessive screen time, especially on the physical and mental health of the youth. The target audience are adolescent teens since they are more likely to be involved online with their peers. This simulator acts as a warning to teens to limit their online presence to avoid facing consequences in their future.</p>

                <p>This project takes the user into an interactive simulator containing a story about a character and their screen time use as they age. This was individually created in DES157B over Spring Quarter of 2024 and went through an iterative process for visuals, functionality, and code. The interface was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

                <p>I originally had a different project idea related to mental health and started my research with a comparative analysis on different storytelling game websites. Although they aren't directly related to the current project, I found their techniques for storytelling useful to consider.</p>

                <p>The games that I observed both had detailed stories that utilizes a choose-your-own adventure feature that allows users to click through different decisions to see various outcomes. Although they are educational, the visual design is too text-heavy and there was not much interaction. They did, however, highlight the most important data and had a main character for the user to resonate with.</p>


                <p>With these pros and cons in mind, I strived to make my project more engaging with visual designs along with a short story. I also wanted to revolve my project around a fictional character to help the user emphasize and resonate with the story a little deeper. Lastly, I knew I wanted to effectively display data in an organized manner so that it would be easy to understand.</p>

                
                <p>Thus, I came up with a how might we statement: How might we narrate informational data in an engaging and interactive way?
                </p>


                <p>I also conducted research on my topic with real life data studying the mental health of young children with prolonged screen use. There is shown to be proof of children being higher risk for cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and obesity when using their phones more. I also found that older people may be more likely to develop dementia and obesity for excessive screen time. This information was crucial to include into my project and is linked on the bottom right corner labeled "Resources."</p>

                <img src="images/story.jpg" width="330" height="230">
                <img src="images/screen.png" width="510" height="250">

            <div class="content">
                <p>I chose to use the font 'Silkscreen' for the main title, 'VT323' for the subheadings, and 'Roboto' for the body text. I used Silkscreen and VT323 as heading fonts because they are bold and fall into theme of the digital realm with a bit of pixelation. Roboto is used for the body text because it is clear and legible, allowing the most important data pieces to be read at ease.</p>

                <p>For the color palette, I used shades of light and dark blue for the main colors and black, white, red, yellow, and green for secondary colors.</p>

                <p>The first screenshot depicts my initial rough sketch which has less engaging colors. It also has more visual clutter, which I reduced in the final product</p>

            <h2>User Interface</h2>
                <img src="images/thumbnail.png" width="760" height="370">
            <div class="content">
                    <p>The layout of the design showcases the adjustable sliders on the left and a character story panel to the right. The slider positions directly affect the information shown on the panel, so I think having them side by side would make the features more intuitive and clear.</p>

                    <p>The sliders themselves have labels and icons to indicate what the user would be effecting: either the screen time or age. There is also a reset button to allow users to reset the sliders back to the default.</p>

                    <p>The character panel displays the character image on the left and the life stage, health status, and story of the character on the right. The character's appearance and data should all change according to the slider adjustments. This creates an organized hierarchy, leading the user to see the character's appearance and then reading the story details next to it.
                    </p>

                    <div class="set">
                        <img src="images/death.png" width="350" height="270">
                        <img src="images/intro.png" width="400" height="270">
                    </div>

                    <p>There is also an overlay of an introduction screen before entering the simulator, as well as a death overlay for when the character dies. This provides background context and a realistic scenario for the user to understand why screen time use is a relevant issue.</p>

                <p>I conducted usability testing with an earlier version of the project, which displayed the screen time slider vertically and the age slider horizontally with 4 distinct life stages. It also had previous emoji in place of the character and the page lacked colors.
                </p>

                <p>After testing, I discovered that users found the slider layout to be difficult to understand at first, especially since they were in different locations. The user was also confused with the emoji character being separated in its own container. This made the character seem unrelated to the story, causing more confusion. Lastly, the text was too lengthy and took the users a while to read everything.</p>

                <div class="set">
                    <img src="images/slide.png" width="260" height="280">
                    <img src="images/info.png" width="550" height="300">
                </div>

                <p>This pushed me to improve the final product to have both of the sliders horizontal and grouped together in a separate panel. I replaced the life stages on the slider with a range of ages 0-100 for a more customizable approach. I also grouped the character image into the detail panel so that it would be more cohesive overall. I then pulled everything together by refining the colors and typography. </p>

                <p>This project has helped me learn how to work more with objects and condition statements in Javascript, as well as my knowledge of CSS. It also helped me improve my graphic design skills with the character changes. However, I feel like the most important thing I learned was the importance of user research and usability testing in order to bring my project to its best quality.</p>

                <p>In terms of challenges, I think the most difficult was figuring out how to create difference variables and outcomes for the character's story with Javascript. It was also hard to work with the sliders, since I hadn't practiced coding them before. However, it was extremely rewarding to be able to turn my vision into reality, and it became even better than what I imagined!</p>
